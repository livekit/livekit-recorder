# LiveKit Recording

All your live recording needs in one place.  
Record any website using our recorder, or deploy our service to manage it for you.

## Service

Simply deploy the [service](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-recorder/tree/main/service), and your livekit server will handle the rest.

## Recorder

Want to record, but haven't made the switch to LiveKit yet? No problem! We built a standalone 
[recorder](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-recorder/tree/main/recorder) that works with any provider (or any website)!

## Templates

Use our pre-built recording [templates](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-recorder/tree/main/web), or create your own.
